Figuring out if building a complete game as a solo game dev has a lot of components to it. It reminds me more of starting a business than a purely creative endeavor. Luckily I've had a lot of fun trying to start a few businesses. And by "few" I mean "more than I've like to admit to here".

So far I've been focusing on three dimensions of work when it comes to building my own game:
- The Technical Side (Programming, Game Development and Design).
- The Business Side (Marketing, Promotion, Networking, Distribution, Budgeting, Forecasting).
- The Art Side (Graphic Design, Game Assets Design).

For the **technical side**, I've been spending a lot of my time learning, building prototypes, and testing out different engines or tools. Since I've been developing software for a while, the technical side of things is starting to fall together pretty quickly. I see how to get from point A to point B, the concepts I would have to figure out along the way, the riskiest parts of a given project, etc.

I can also get a general feel for the **"business" side**. I've helped run a small software development agency and have also started a couple of small businesses on my own.

What I didn't expect being the biggest hurdle is **art**.

## How long would it take?

On a scale of 1-10, I probably fall somewhere around a 3 or 4 on art ability. I've always drawn a bit for fun or have learned small tricks from my dad who studied art. I liked to do charcoal drawings throughout high school and college for example, but getting a workflow going to generate the assets for an entire game is another story.

Based on the handful of assets I've worked on over the last few weeks, I think it would take 600+ hours for even a small game.

Maybe all of my ideas so far have too much scope considering my current ability. I'm working towards putting together a simple, complete game within a month or two of development so obviously spending 4-6 months full time on art isn't going to work.

## Looking at stock assets.

I've been using stock asset packs from the Unity assets store for prototyping, but if I'm trying to release an original game (even a small, simple one) I'd prefer to have unique assets.

## Today's work.

Now after spewing out all of my concerns, ironically today I've felt pretty productive with art. I've created designs around a puzzler prototype I'm working on and was able to kick out some pretty cool looking stuff in a few hours today. I've been using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) to make pixel art.

Here's a train sprite and animation I've worked on this afternoon:

## So what's next?

Two options basically:

1. Find an artist to work with.
2. Just keep practicing.

For now, since I'm still just having fun with game dev as a hobby, I'll see how #2 goes. Wish me luck. :)
